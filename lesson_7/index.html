					In 1962, journalist Chow Mo-wan (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) and his wife move into a Hong Kong apartment, but
					Chow's spouse is often away on business. Before long, the lonely Chow makes the acquaintance of the
					alluring Su Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung Man-yuk), whose own significant other also seems preoccupied with
					work. As the two friends realize their respective partners are cheating on them, they begin to fall for
					one another; however, neither wants to stoop to the level of the unfaithful spouses.
				</p>
				<p class="two">
					When I fist watched the movie, I said to myself, "so a film can be made like this." Wong Kar Wai's
					gorgeous poetic love story captured me throughout and even after the film. I must admit this is one of
					the best love movies, maybe the best of all, I have ever watched. The content and the form overlaps
					perfectly. As watching the secret love we see the characters in bounded frames that limits their
					movements as well as their feelings. Beautiful camera angles and the lighting makes the feelings and the
					blues even touchable. I want to congratulate Christopher Doyle and Pin Bing Lee for their fantastic
					cinematography which creates the mood for love. Also the music defines the sadness of the love which
					plays along the beautiful slow motion frames and shows the characters in despairing moods. And of course
					the performances of the actors which makes the love so real. Eventually, all the elements in the film
					combined in a perfect way under the direction of WKW and give the audience the feeling called love.

					Pulp Fiction is a 1994 American crime film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, who conceived it
					with Roger Avary.[4] Starring John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Tim Roth, Ving Rhames, and
					Uma Thurman, it tells several stories of crime in Los Angeles. The title refers to the pulp magazines and
					hardboiled crime novels popular during the mid-20th century, known for their graphic violence and punchy
					dialogue. Tarantino wrote Pulp Fiction in 1992 and 1993, incorporating scenes that Avary originally wrote
					for True Romance (1993). Its plot occurs out of chronological order. The film is also self-referential
					from its opening moments, beginning with a title card that gives two dictionary definitions of "pulp".
					Considerable screen time is devoted to monologues and casual conversations with eclectic dialogue
					revealing each character's perspectives on several subjects, and the film features an ironic combination
					of humor and strong violence. TriStar Pictures reportedly turned down the script as "too demented".
					Miramax co-chairman Harvey Weinstein was enthralled, however, and the film became the first that Miramax
					fully financed.

					This 11-vignette film focuses on the human interactions that happen while partaking in the everyday
					indulgence of coffee and cigarettes. Featuring well-known actors and other artists as themselves or some
					version thereof, the film highlights the nuances and subtle hostilities that can be a part of seemingly
					normal conversations. Bill Murray waits on the Wu-Tang Clan, Iggy Pop and Tom Waits get on each others'
					nerves and Jack and Meg White of the White Stripes discuss Nikola Tesla.
				</p>
				<p class="five">
					The film is composed of a comic series of short vignettes shot in black and white built on one another to
					create a cumulative effect, as the characters discuss things such as caffeine popsicles, Paris in the
					1920s, and the use of nicotine as an insecticide – all while sitting around drinking coffee and smoking
					cigarettes. The theme of the film is absorption in the obsessions, joys, and addictions of life, and
					there are many common threads between vignettes, such as the Tesla coil, medical knowledge, the
					suggestion that coffee and cigarettes don't make for a healthy meal (generally lunch), cousins, The Lees
					(Cinqué and Joie, and a mention of Spike Lee), delirium, miscommunication, musicians, the similarities
					between musicianship and medical skill, industrial music, acknowledged fame, and the idea of drinking
					coffee before sleeping in order to have fast dreams. In each of the segments of the film, the common
					motif of alternating black and white tiles can be seen in some fashion. The visual use of black and white
					relates to the theme of interpersonal contrasts, as each vignette features two people who disagree
					completely yet manage to sit amicably at the same table This 11-vignette film focuses on the human
					interactions that happen while partaking in the everyday indulgence of coffee and cigarettes. Featuring
